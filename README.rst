********************

eternitychatbot-core is wrapper over `Chatterbot <https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot>`_ library for easier usage.
Only necessary functionality: getting/learning/removing responses. The package is documented with docstrings,
so you can find methods descriptions, arguments types and what do methods return right in the code.
It is not designed for end users and if you are one of them, package is useless for you.
Instead you can look at my applications, that uses this library in my `GitHub profile <https://github.com/r4nx>`_.
